After you set up your data ingestions, the next steps are:

1.  [Enrich Events with Additional
    Data](enrich-events-with-additional-data.html "Enrich Events with Additional Data")
    — In most cases, you will want to enrich your raw events with
    additional data. Enrichment provides more flexibility for
    correlating your alerts into meaningful incidents. Enrichment also
    makes your alerts more informative and readable.

2.  [Event deduplication: how-to and best
    practices](event-deduplication.html "Event deduplication: how-to and best practices")
    — In some cases, you might want to fine-tune the logic for
    deduplicating your events into alerts.
